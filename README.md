# Personal Learnings

### Creating an in interface of an object is completely arbitrary, and mainly only there to give the structure of the object and does not get compiled.

### A class is just a template of properties an object should have.

### Using routes to a path for different pages.

### NPM installing the ng2-page-transition to create page transition effects.

### Adding classes dynamically using NgClass to only add class when condition is true.

### Data binding establishes a connecting between the UI and the model component, so when the model changes, the UI changes with it.

### In this project, I discovered HTML has a built in audio tag that could run on page load.

### I learned which Form Modules to import for validation and creating conditional statements for it.

### Using *ngFor is exactly like a foreach loop, I can access objects in arrays and later place that object property straight into my HTML.

### Creating route variables to link the correct path to pages mathching URL's.

### Creating an API.ts to store the values of all API links, later to be exported to their correct components.

### Dynamically adding data to a text area and populating a list.
